**Problem Statement addressed:
GraphRE: A graph database comparable model for real estate.

<!-- 
Could be larger impact but not as developed.
GraphResponse: A ge raph database system for incident response
 -->

**Description**: 

Find undervalued properties using graph-based relationships on TigerGraph.

Comparables for real estate valuation are often derived at the discretion of the real estate agent, or simply based off the zestimate or redfin estimate for a property.

However these are extremely opaque.

GraphRE provides a graph based solution that allows querying a given property and finding the relationships against recently sold properties.

Key graph elements:
* Descriptive words (renovated, new kitchen, new bathroom, flooring, etc.)

Standard quantitative fields:
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Square footage

* Relationships between different property keywords.
* Find corresponding properties based on graph relationships matching multiple criteria simultaneously.

Wanted to use a graph databases to create a model for valuation that's understandable

* Helps reduce bias in real estate pricing.
* Ingests and graphs data through several mainstream real estate websites, including Redfin, Zillow, and Trulia.
* Creates an AI model in real time and serves it.
